>Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
>Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?
```
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

如果还无法解决，报错：dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. 

再输入： sudo dpkg --configure -a

```
